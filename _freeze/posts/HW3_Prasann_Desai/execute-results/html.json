This limited the range of analysis and the variety of data attributes. Today, with the usage of advanced technology, hundreds of attributes describing a game are being recorded in real-time. This has enabled a wide range of research in the field of soccer analytics and led to the emergence of various soccer data aggregators like StatsBomb, FBref, Understat, Fotmob, etc. In this project, we will be using the data from these aggregators using the *worldfootballR* package in R. This package has been created by Jason Zivkovic that enables users to conveniently access data belonging to the above-mentioned aggregators in R. \n\nThe goal of the project will be to find performance attributes that best predict success in the game. We would want to see the following aspects: \n\n- What are the best teams/players good at? We will compare their aggregate statistics like goals, xG, Goal difference, etc.\n- Does higher xG (Expected Goals) correspond to higher league position? Any trends over years?\n- Which team has been the most unlucky? Here, we will analyse the difference between XG and Actual goals to see which teams couldn't secure points despite performing well.\n\n# Data\n\nThis dataset allows us to obtain soccer game/team/player data with various attributes. The attributes are both categorical and numerical. The attributes describing a game are goals scored by the home/away team, assists, game result, corners taken, shots attempted, etc. Similar attributes are also recorded at a team and player level. The dataset also contains some advanced attributes like xG and xA that are widely accepted in the soccer analytics industry to describe the quality of actions of players/teams in quantitative terms. We will be making use of xG and related stats to determine if it is a good indicator of success (better points earned in the league, more goals scored, etc.). For simplicity, we will be using the stats of the 1st tier of English Premier League Football for our analysis.\n\nThis is a sample dataset call. Further in the project, we could change a couple of parameters in the dataset call for comparative analysis, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprem_team_2023_shooting <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"ENG\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = \"2023\", tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"shooting\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(prem_team_2023_shooting)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Competition_Name\"       \"Gender\"                 \"Country\"               \n [4] \"Season_End_Year\"        \"Squad\"                  \"Team_or_Opponent\"      \n [7] \"Num_Players\"            \"Mins_Per_90\"            \"Gls_Standard\"          \n[10] \"Sh_Standard\"            \"SoT_Standard\"           \"SoT_percent_Standard\"  \n[13] \"Sh_per_90_Standard\"     \"SoT_per_90_Standard\"    \"G_per_Sh_Standard\"     \n[16] \"G_per_SoT_Standard\"     \"Dist_Standard\"          \"FK_Standard\"           \n[19] \"PK_Standard\"            \"PKatt_Standard\"         \"xG_Expected\"           \n[22] \"npxG_Expected\"          \"npxG_per_Sh_Expected\"   \"G_minus_xG_Expected\"   \n[25] \"np:G_minus_xG_Expected\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Attribute Information\n\n1)  Competition_Name (str, categorical): Name of the Competition\n2)  Gender (str, categorical): Gender category of the competition\n3)  Country (str, categorical): Country of the competition\n4)  Season_End_Year (int, numerical): Year of end of the competition season\n5)  Squad (str, categorical): Name of the team\n6)  Team_or_Opponent (str, categorical): Takes only two values - 'team' and 'opponent'.

A common practice is to view the teams based on their xGFor and xGAgainst on a grid and choose the teams on the bottom right of that graph. The graph \"xG_For vs. xG_Against\" below does just that. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pre-processing\n# selecting the required columns\nprem_2023_shooting_1 <- select(prem_team_2023_shooting, Squad, Team_or_Opponent, npxG_Expected)\nprem_2023_shooting_1 <- mutate(prem_2023_shooting_1, Squad = case_when(str_detect(Squad, \"vs \") ~ str_split(Squad, \"vs \", simplify = TRUE)[,2],\n                                                                     TRUE ~ as.character(Squad)\n                                                                     ))\n# Using the pivot_wider function to pivot the dataset\nprem_2023_shooting_pivoted <- pivot_wider(prem_2023_shooting_1, names_from = \"Team_or_Opponent\", values_from = \"npxG_Expected\")\nprem_2023_shooting_pivoted <- rename(prem_2023_shooting_pivoted, xG_For = team, xG_Against = opponent)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Building a scatter plot of xG_For and xG_Against\n\nggplot(prem_2023_shooting_pivoted,\n       aes(x = xG_For,\n           y = xG_Against,\n           col = Squad\n           )) +\n  geom_text(aes(y = xG_Against - 1, label = Squad), size = 3) + \n  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(x = \"Expected Goals Scored\",\n       y = \"Expected Goals Conceded\",\n       title = \"xG_For vs. xG_Against\",\n       subtitle = \"xG For vs. Against comparison of all Premier league teams for season of 2022-2023\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_Prasann_Desai_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\nYou'll see that there is group of 6 teams that have separated themselves from the rest - They are Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Brighton, Newcastle Utd & Manchester Utd.

Bottom 14 teams is the volume of shots taken. This insight can also be extended to individual player performances. A similar analysis for player performance was done by Omar Chaudhuri from \"Twenty First Group\" that stated that statistically what separates top-tier players like Ronaldo, Messi is the the volume of shots that they attempt every match from high goal probability positions (basically, high xG). \n\n### Comparison of Average \"expected\" non-penalty goals (xnpG) \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_bar_facet_avg(prem_team_2023_shooting, category_var = \"Team_or_Opponent\", facet_var = \"Team type\", measure = \"npxG_Expected\",\n                   chart_title = \"Average volume of goal scoring chances created in a season\", \n                   subtitle = \"Comparison of the metric For v.

For coaches and teams around the world, it is like a north-star metric that lies at the heart of all the new tactics/strategies that are devised to achieve higher league positions over a season. Interestingly, xG accumulated over a season/year at a player level can also be used for new player purchase strategies -- there are hidden gems with under-rated goal-scoring abilities across the world that sometimes get overshadowed by their teams' bad luck/under-performance but statistically have high individual xGs. \n\n\n## Does higher xG (Expected Goals) correspond to higher league position?\n\n### Visualising the linear relation between xG and Goals scored\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Building a x-y plot of npxG_Expected and Goals scored\nprem_team_2023_shooting_for <- filter(prem_team_2023_shooting, Team_or_Opponent == \"For\")\n\nggplot(prem_team_2023_shooting_for,\n       aes(x = npxG_Expected,\n           y = Gls_Standard,\n           col = `Team type`\n           )) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) + \n  stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = 'y~x', col = \"purple\") +\n  labs(x = \"Non-penalty Expected Goals Scored\",\n       y = \"Goals Scored\",\n       title = \"Volume of good quality chances created vs. Goals Scored\",\n       subtitle = \"Checking linear correlation between npxG and Goals scored for 2022-2023 season\"\n       ) +\n  theme()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_Prasann_Desai_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the above plot, it is intuitive to infer that there is a positive correlation between Non-Penalty xG and Goals scored i.e. Higher volume of goal scoring opportunities created lead to more number of goals. We know that, more goals scored lead to more wins. Consequently, the teams with higher Non-Penalty xG lead to higher league positions (See how the Top 6 teams separate themselves from the rest). Statistically, there is also an understanding in the soccer analytics industry that higher Non-Penalty xG is a better measure of team performance despite of the eventual league position. To validate this viewpoint, let's now look at the trend of Non-Penalty xG / Regular xG vs League Performance (League Position) over the past 4 years.  \n\n###  xG vs League Performance trends over last 4 years\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Pre-processing data for past 4 years\n# 2023 Data\npre_processed_shooting_table_df_for <- function(year) { \nprem_team_2023_shooting <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"ENG\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = year, tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"shooting\")\nprem_team_2023_shooting <- mutate(prem_team_2023_shooting, Squad = case_when(str_detect(Squad, \"vs \") ~ str_split(Squad, \"vs \", simplify = TRUE)[,2],\n                                                                     TRUE ~ as.character(Squad)\n                                                                     ))\nprem_team_2023_shooting <- mutate(prem_team_2023_shooting, Team_or_Opponent = case_when(str_detect(Team_or_Opponent, \"opponent\") ~ \"Against\",\n                                                                              str_detect(Team_or_Opponent, \"team\") ~ \"For\",\n                                                                              TRUE ~ \"NA\"\n                                                                            ))\nprem_2023_league_table <- fb_season_team_stats(country = \"ENG\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = year, tier = \"1st\", stat_type = \"league_table\")\n\ncombined_df <- left_join(prem_team_2023_shooting, prem_2023_league_table, by = \"Squad\")\ncombined_df <- filter(combined_df, Team_or_Opponent.x == \"For\")\ncombined_df <- mutate(combined_df, npxG_Expected_norm = rescale(npxG_Expected, to = c(0,20)))\ncombined_df <- mutate(combined_df, xGD_norm = rescale(xGD, to = c(0,20))) %>% arrange(desc(npxG_Expected)) %>% mutate(npxG_Expected_Rank = rank(desc(npxG_Expected)))\n\ncombined_df\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprem_stats_2020 <- pre_processed_shooting_table_df_for(\"2020\")\nprem_stats_2021 <- pre_processed_shooting_table_df_for(\"2021\")\nprem_stats_2022 <- pre_processed_shooting_table_df_for(\"2022\")\nprem_stats_2023 <- pre_processed_shooting_table_df_for(\"2023\")\nfinal_df <- rbind(prem_stats_2020, prem_stats_2021, prem_stats_2022, prem_stats_2023)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Building a x-y plot of npxG_Expected and League Rank\nggplot(final_df,\n       aes(x = npxG_Expected_norm,\n           y = Rk,\n           color = Rk\n           )) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Season_End_Year.y`, ncol = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(x = \"Normalized npxG to a scale of 0-20\",\n       y = \"League Rank\",\n       title = \"Volume of good quality chances created vs. League Rank\",\n       subtitle = \"Linear correlation between scaled npxG and League Rank for past 4 years\",\n       color = \"League Rank\"\n       ) +\n  theme_linedraw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_Prasann_Desai_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Building a x-y plot of xGD and League Rank\nggplot(final_df,\n       aes(x = xGD_norm,\n           y = Rk,\n           color = Rk\n           )) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Season_End_Year.y`, ncol = 2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(x = \"Normalized xGD to a scale of 0-20\",\n       y = \"League Rank\",\n       title = \"Volume of good quality chances created vs. League Rank\",\n       subtitle = \"Linear correlation between scaled xGD and League Rank for past 4 years\",\n       color = \"League Rank\"\n       ) +\n  theme_linedraw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_Prasann_Desai_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the above two plots, we can conclude that over the last 4 years there is a positive correlation between better league positions and higher non-penalty/regular xG produced by the teams. As you can observe, there are some teams/instances where there is a deviation from the expected linear trend. This deviation is attributed to teams that under-perform (goals scored < xG) their xG which essentially means that over the course the season, these teams were unlucky at converting the goal scoring opportunities to actual goals. Although goals win matches and the final league positions are the most important, we must be mindful of this nuance. Teams sometimes produce high xG but end up at lower league positions. We must not be quick to conclude that such teams are poor overall. \n\nIntersting fact: At the end of 2014-15 season, a german soccer club and regular top-6 finishing team called \"Borussia Dortmund\" sacked their coach Jurgen Klopp because they finished much lower in the table. But, statistically, on the basis of xG, Dortmund was performing like a top-6 team even that season! Seems like they were just unlucky and hastily ended up sacking one the best coaches in world football!!\n\nBased on this knowledge, let's look in the next section, which teams were more unlucky than others.\n\n## Which team has been the most unlucky in the 2022-23 season? \n\nWe'll look at teams that couldn't secure points despite performing well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot to see under/over performance of teams compared to their xG\n# final_df\nfinal_df_v2 <- filter(final_df, `Season_End_Year.y` == \"2023\") #| `Season_End_Year.y` == \"2022\")\n\nfinal_df_v2 <- mutate(final_df_v2, `Team type` = case_when(Rk < 7 ~ \"Top 6\",\n                                                                      TRUE ~ \"Bottom 14\"\n                                                                      ))\nfinal_df_v2 <- mutate(final_df_v2, Over_perform_flag = case_when((npxG_Expected_Rank - Rk) > 0 ~ \"Over-perform\",\n                                                                 (npxG_Expected_Rank - Rk) < 0 ~ \"Under-perform\",\n                                                                 TRUE ~ \"As Expected\"\n                                                                 ))\nggplot(final_df_v2, aes(x = Rk, y = npxG_Expected_Rank - Rk, color = Over_perform_flag)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~`Season_End_Year.y`, ncol = 1) +\n  #scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Over-perform\" = \"green\", \"Under-perform\" = \"red\", \"As Expected\" = \"yellow\")) +\n  labs(x = \"League Rank\",\n       y = \"Measure of Overperformance\",\n       title = \"Under/over performance of teams compared to their xG by League Rank\",\n       subtitle = \"Based on League data for the 2022-2023 season\",\n       color = \"League Performance\"\n       ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(1, 20, by=1))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(seq(-10, 10, by=2))) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Squad, \", \", npxG_Expected_Rank - Rk)),\n            color = \"black\",\n            size = 2.5,\n            vjust = 2,\n            angle = 30\n            ) +\n  theme_linedraw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_Prasann_Desai_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=1056}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the above plot, the teams have been arranged based on their league position from left to right. We have calculated a measure called \"npxG_Expected_Rank\" that is analogous to expected rank based on npxG alone. The y-axis of the plot is the difference between the actual rank and the expected rank. A couple of interesting things to look at here -- Fulham, Crystal Palace and Wolves have all over-performed this season. This means that, there are teams below them in the table that have actually performed better than them in the 2023 season. If luck had gone out of the window, they might have found themselves in the relegation battle. Obviously, over-performance of some teams are also a factor in under-performance of other teams. Interestingly, we need to look at the two teams that have highly under-performed: Leicester City and Leeds United. Unfortunately and unluckily, despite their relatively better performances, these teams ended up getting relegated from the league this season and their managers/coaches getting sacked. A deviation for 7 league positions from the expected league position is worth noting, and the teams should have enough confidence in them next season to get promoted back to the Premier league.\n\n# Pending sections for final project\n\n1) Conclusion\n2) Citations/Bibliography\n3) Critical reflection\n\n\n\n\n",
