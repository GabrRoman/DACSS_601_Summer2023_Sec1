Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Function call to read a csv file\nrailroad_2012_clean_county <- read_csv(\"_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Displaying the first few records from the dataset\nrailroad_2012_clean_county\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n   state county               total_employees\n   <chr> <chr>                          <dbl>\n 1 AE    APO                                2\n 2 AK    ANCHORAGE                          7\n 3 AK    FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n 4 AK    JUNEAU                             3\n 5 AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA                  2\n 6 AK    SITKA                              1\n 7 AK    SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY              88\n 8 AL    AUTAUGA                          102\n 9 AL    BALDWIN                          143\n10 AL    BARBOUR                            1\n# … with 2,920 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nFrom the above output, we can see that there are 3 main attributes in the dataset namely - state, county and total_employees. Judging by the dataset file name and the underlying data, we can make a fair guess that the total_employees column describes the total number of employees working for railroad at a state-county granularity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(railroad_2012_clean_county$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 87.17816\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmedian(railroad_2012_clean_county$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 21\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nFrom the output of the above two functions we can see that the mean number of employees at state-county level is 87.17 and the median is 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
