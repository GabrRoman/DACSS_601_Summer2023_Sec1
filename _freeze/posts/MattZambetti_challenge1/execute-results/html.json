Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# getting the data with the read.csv command\nrailroad_data <- read.csv(\"_data/railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\")\n\n# printing the first 10 rows\nhead(railroad_data, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   state               county total_employees\n1     AE                  APO               2\n2     AK            ANCHORAGE               7\n3     AK FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR               2\n4     AK               JUNEAU               3\n5     AK    MATANUSKA-SUSITNA               2\n6     AK                SITKA               1\n7     AK SKAGWAY MUNICIPALITY              88\n8     AL              AUTAUGA             102\n9     AL              BALDWIN             143\n10    AL              BARBOUR               1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\nFrom what we can see using the \"head\" command, there are three columns: state, county, and total number of employees for each railroad.\n\nI predict that the data was gathered either from on online registry with the department of labor or something similar, or this was done via survey. The survey would consist of the surveyor sending a request to each station to report how many employees there were at that particular station.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Lets sort the data\nsorted <- railroad_data[order(railroad_data$total_employees, decreasing = TRUE),]\n\n# 10 stations with the most employees\nhead(sorted, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     state           county total_employees\n659     IL             COOK            8207\n2585    TX          TARRANT            4235\n1747    NE          DOUGLAS            3797\n1932    NY          SUFFOLK            3685\n2685    VA INDEPENDENT CITY            3249\n301     FL            DUVAL            3073\n195     CA   SAN BERNARDINO            2888\n178     CA      LOS ANGELES            2545\n2484    TX           HARRIS            2535\n1773    NE          LINCOLN            2289\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 10 stations with the least employees\ntail(sorted, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     state    county total_employees\n2582    TX  STEPHENS               1\n2583    TX STONEWALL               1\n2609    TX   WILLACY               1\n2625    UT     GRAND               1\n2634    UT    SEVIER               1\n2691    VA LANCASTER               1\n2715    VA  RICHMOND               1\n2757    WA     FERRY               1\n2759    WA  GARFIELD               1\n2865    WV    GILMER               1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe two tables above, we can see the first contains the 10 stations with the most employees and in the second one, we can see the 10 stations with the least employees.\n\nThese two tables could be helpful for the challenge of distributing funds. For example, a station with more employees could be funded more since their payroll is higher than that of a station with fewer.\n\nAlso, stations with more employees is likely to be more populated leading to more wear and tear on the station. So, the upkeep of these stations is probably greater as well.",
