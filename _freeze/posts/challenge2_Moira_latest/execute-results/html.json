Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n#This data set was a much larger dataset than in Challenge 1. There was a mix of categorical and numerical data. There were 14 columns of variables, with 30977 rows of observations. The variable, BIrds$Value had the following summary statistics:\n  \n # Value Summary Statistics\n#Mean 99410.63\n#Median 1800\n#IQR 15233\n\n#I did some simple proportion statistics on Birds$Item, or seeing the proportionality of chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowls, pigeons and other birds and turkeys:\n  \n  \n # \n  #Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls   Pigeons, other birds \n#0.42205507             0.22303645             0.13351842             0.03760855 \n#Turkeys \n#0.18378152 \n\n#From this analysis it can be seen that Chickens at 42%, then Ducks at 22% followed by Turkeys (18%) were most prevalent in the dataset. I also tabulated the data by Area and Item, and found that \n\n#In 2018, there were the following instances of Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys:\n  \n # Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys \n#2018       240   128                     78                   21     110\n\n\n#The summary statistics on the item category for the Value variable is as follows.
