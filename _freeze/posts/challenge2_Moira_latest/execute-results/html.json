More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n#This data set was a much larger dataset than in Challenge 1. There was a mix of categorical and numerical data. There were 14 columns of variables, with 30977 rows of observations. The variable, BIrds$Value had the following summary statistics:\n  \n # Value Summary Statistics\n#Mean 99410.63\n#Median 1800\n#IQR 15233\n\n#I did some simple proportion statistics on Birds$Item, or seeing the proportionality of chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowls, pigeons and other birds and turkeys:\n  \n  \n # \n  #Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls   Pigeons, other birds \n#0.42205507             0.22303645             0.13351842             0.03760855 \n#Turkeys \n#0.18378152 \n\n#From this analysis it can be seen that Chickens at 42%, then Ducks at 22% followed by Turkeys (18%) were most prevalent in the dataset. I also tabulated the data by Area and Item, and found that \n\n#In 2018, there were the following instances of Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys:\n  \n # Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys \n#2018       240   128                     78                   21     110\n\n\n#The summary statistics on the item category for the Value variable is as follows. Note that Chickens had the highest mean and median, followed by Ducks and Turkeys.\n\n#$Chickens\n#Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.

Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed.
