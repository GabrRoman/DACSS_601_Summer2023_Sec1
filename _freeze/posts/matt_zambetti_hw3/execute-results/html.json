I have chosen salary data which contains entries that list age, gender, education level, role, experience, and monthly salary of each employee.\n\nI got the data at: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data?resource=download)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworkers_tidy <- read_csv(\"_data/Salary_Data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 6704 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): Gender, Education Level, Job Title\ndbl (3): Age, Years of Experience, Salary\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworkers_tidy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,704 × 6\n     Age Gender `Education Level` `Job Title`       `Years of Experience` Salary\n   <dbl> <chr>  <chr>             <chr>                             <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1    32 Male   Bachelor's        Software Engineer                     5  90000\n 2    28 Female Master's          Data Analyst                          3  65000\n 3    45 Male   PhD               Senior Manager                       15 150000\n 4    36 Female Bachelor's        Sales Associate                       7  60000\n 5    52 Male   Master's          Director                             20 200000\n 6    29 Male   Bachelor's        Marketing Analyst                     2  55000\n 7    42 Female Master's          Product Manager                      12 120000\n 8    31 Male   Bachelor's        Sales Manager                         4  80000\n 9    26 Female Bachelor's        Marketing Coordi…                     1  45000\n10    38 Male   PhD               Senior Scientist                     10 110000\n# ℹ 6,694 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cleaning the Data Set\n\nIn my opinion, there is nothing I need to do with cleaning the data. It is nicely organized and in a \"tidy\" form.\n\nThe only variable I had to change was some entries contained 'phD' instead of 'PhD'.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworkers_tidy$`Education Level`[workers_tidy$`Education Level`=='phD'] <- 'PhD'\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Narrative About the Data Set\n\nTaking a deeper look at the data set, we can see that age is a double, gender is character data (seems to be either male or female), education level is also character data (includes Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD), job title is character data, years of experience is a double, and then salary is also a double.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (idx in 2:6) {\n  cat(colnames(workers_tidy)[idx], \": \", sapply(workers_tidy[idx], typeof),\"\\n\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGender :  character \nEducation Level :  character \nJob Title :  character \nYears of Experience :  double \nSalary :  double \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Potential Research Questions\nMany people look into salary data based off of job title and what degree you have. I am interested in analyzing salary data from the other points that this data provides. \n\nI think that many of these variables are overlooked. Many new graduates (including myself) want to make a lot of money, but what is a lot of money. Comparing across my program (Computer Science) the mean salary after graduation is somewhere around $120k. This is a lot of money, but how does this compare to others in my similar boat? Should I be disappointed if a job offers be less? \n\nAlthough there are plenty other factors that determine salary, such as location/cost of living, I think this data is a good place to start, and can also show trends of salaries so people navigating job offers know what to expect now or in the future.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations\nLets do mean/median/range salary by profession, education level, and years of experience.\n\nIn this first box, we'll calculate the mean/median/range for Salary when it is grouped by age, education level, and years of experience.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculating Mean/Median of Salary\n\n##### Based on Age\n# Mean\nmean_salary_age <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(Age) %>%\n  summarise(mean_sal=mean(Salary))\n# Median\nmedian_salary_age <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(Age) %>%\n  summarise(median=median(Salary))\n# Range\nrange_salary_age <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(Age) %>%\n  summarise(range=max(Salary)-min(Salary))\n\n##### Based on Education Level\n# Mean\nmean_salary_edu <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Education Level`) %>%\n  summarise(mean=mean(Salary))\n# Median\nmedian_salary_edu <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Education Level`) %>%\n  summarise(median=median(Salary))\n# Range\nrange_salary_edu <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Education Level`) %>%\n  summarise(range=max(Salary)-min(Salary))\n\n\n##### Based on Years of Experience\n# Mean\nmean_salary_exp <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Years of Experience`) %>%\n  summarise(mean=mean(Salary))\n# Median\nmedian_salary_exp <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Years of Experience`) %>%\n  summarise(median=median(Salary))\n# Range\nrange_salary_exp <- workers_tidy %>%\n  group_by(`Years of Experience`) %>%\n  summarise(range=max(Salary)-min(Salary))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we're going to visualize this data. For each of the variables we will have one or two plots for the mean and median.\n\nFirst, for age:\n\nHere we can quite clearly see a positive correlation between salary and age. The one thing to note is that it seems the salary plateaus somewhere around 50 years. This could be that people are close to retiring so they are not being promoted as often, and or less people are working.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsalary_age <- data.frame(mean_salary_age$Age, mean_salary_age$mean_sal, median_salary_age$median)\nsalary_age <- pivot_longer(salary_age, cols=c('mean_salary_age.mean_sal', \n                                              'median_salary_age.median'), names_to='variable',\n                                              values_to=\"value\")\n  \nsalary_age %>% ggplot(aes(x=mean_salary_age.Age, y=value, fill=variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +\n  labs(title='Mean and Median Salary by Age', y='Salary', x='Age')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 8 rows containing missing values (`geom_bar()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matt_zambetti_hw3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nNext for Education Level:\n\nIn education level we can see a massive increase from High School to College, which is expected. The interesting to note here is the comparison of Master's to PhD. It seems that Master's students make less on average, but the median Master's graduate is making more than the median PhD graduate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsalary_edu <- data.frame(mean_salary_edu$`Education Level`, mean_salary_edu$mean, median_salary_edu$median)\nsalary_edu <- na.omit(salary_edu)\nsalary_edu <- pivot_longer(salary_edu, cols=c('mean_salary_edu.mean', \n                                              'median_salary_edu.median'), names_to='variable',\n                                              values_to=\"value\")\n  \nsalary_edu %>% ggplot(aes(x=mean_salary_edu..Education.Level., y=value, fill=variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +\n  labs(title='Mean and Median Salary by Education Level', y='Salary', x='Education Level')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matt_zambetti_hw3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext for Years of Experience:\n\nFinally, in years of experience we notice the same trend as in Age. A steady increase between 0 to 15 years of experience, then a steady plateau after that.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsalary_exp <- data.frame(mean_salary_exp$`Years of Experience`, mean_salary_exp$mean, median_salary_exp$median)\nsalary_exp <- na.omit(salary_exp)\nsalary_exp <- pivot_longer(salary_exp, cols=c('mean_salary_exp.mean', \n                                              'median_salary_exp.median'), names_to='variable',\n                                              values_to=\"value\")\n  \nsalary_exp %>% ggplot(aes(x=mean_salary_exp..Years.of.Experience., y=value, fill=variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +\n  labs(title='Mean and Median Salary by Years of Experience', y='Salary', x='Years of Experience')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](matt_zambetti_hw3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nThese visualizations/statistics only show general statistics. There is a lot of information that may not be useful to someone figuring out what they're worth. For example, most people in this class and program are going to graduate with a Master's Degree and this data shows salaries with High School, Bachelor's and PhDs.\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\nPiggybacking off of the above note, I think there are still plenty of unanswered questions pertaining to more specific insights. I would like to trim the data down a bit more into categories base on Education Level, cutting out High School and maybe combining PhD and Master's since they could be grouped into a category of \"Graduate School\". Then from here breaking them down even further into categories such as Job Title and then examining the various statistics in more detail.\n\n### What is unclear\n\nI think these plot are very saturated. What I mean by this, is that there is almost too much data. I think that for the next iteration of the project I am going to split the `workers_tidy` data into multiple datasets based on Profession. I think this will be more useful to me and other students when trying to compare.\n\n\n\n",
