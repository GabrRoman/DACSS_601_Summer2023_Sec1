data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)\n2)  tidy data (as needed, including sanity checks)\n3)  identify variables that need to be mutated\n4)  mutate variables and sanity check all mutations\n\n## Read in data\n\n-   abc_poll.csv ⭐\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nabc_poll <- read.csv(\"_data/abc_poll_2021.csv\",
