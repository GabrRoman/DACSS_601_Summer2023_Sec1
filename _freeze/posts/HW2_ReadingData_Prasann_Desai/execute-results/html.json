This limited the range of analysis and the variety of data attributes. Today, with the usage of advanced technology, hundreds of attributes describing a game are being recorded in real-time. This has enabled a wide range of research in the field of soccer analytics and led to the emergence of various soccer data aggregators like StatsBomb, FBref, Understat, Fotmob, etc. In this project, we will be using the data from these aggregators using the *worldfootballR* package in R. This package has been created by Jason Zivkovic that enables users to conveniently access data belonging to the above-mentioned aggregators in R. \n\nThe goal of the project will be to find performance attributes that best predict success in the game. We would want to see the following aspects: \n\n- What are the best teams/players good at? We will compare their aggregate statistics like goals, assists, xG, xA, Goal difference, etc.\n- Is xG a good indicator of success? Any trends over years?\n- Which team has been the most unlucky? Here, we will analyse the difference between XG and Actual goals to see which teams couldn't secure points despite performing well.\n\n## Data\n\nThis dataset allows us to obtain soccer game/team/player data with various attributes. The attributes are both categorical and numerical. The attributes describing a game are goals scored by the home/away team, assists, game result, corners taken, shots attempted, etc. Similar attributes are also recorded at a team and player level. The dataset also contains some advanced attributes like xG and xA that are widely accepted in the soccer analytics industry to describe the quality of actions of players/teams in quantitative terms. We will be making use of xG and related stats to determine if it is a good indicator of success (better points earned in the league, more goals scored, etc.). For simplicity, we will be using the stats of the 1st tier of English Premier League Football for our analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This is a sample dataset call.
