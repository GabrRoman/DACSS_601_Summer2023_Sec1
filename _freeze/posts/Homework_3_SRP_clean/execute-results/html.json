Throughout, I have listed questions that I intend to resolve, and areas for further development. As part of  including possible questions and visualizations. \n\nHere is my biggest question: Thus far, I have been working with data in an extremely long form -- wherein variables are listed in a single column represented as an indicator name. In other words, each indicator name represents a combination of values such as gender, level of schooling, indicator type such as % attainment or % net enrollment.\n\nAs of now, the \"value\" column of my dataframe contains numbers that all represent different kinds of values ... the column is meaningless unless I select a group of indicators that all have values of a similar type. So I have been doing just that - selecting a set of indicators that are the same type of observation (and therefore have values of the same type), creating a dataframe for that group, and plotting it accordingly. \n\nI wondering if I have gone down the wrong path, though, and should have tidied the entire dataset so that each row is a unique observation of year, indicator type, gender, level of schooling, etc. \n\nI would appreciate any advice! \n\n\n## Introduction - Draft, to be expanded after analysis\n\nUsing data compiled by the World Bank over the last half-century, this report compares changes in participation and outcomes across males and females in the Bhutanese education system in the context of changes in the teacher population and national education reforms. This report looks at trends in girls’ and women’s educational participation and attainment in last 25 years, with special attentin to years since Bhutan’s political transition to democracy (in 2008). The discussion contextualizes these trends within major developments in Bhutan's modern secular education system. \n\n## World Development Indicators\n\nThe Development Data Group at the World Bank collects, compiles, and disseminates statistical and data work and maintains macro, financial and sector databases for countries and regions worldwide. According to the World Bank Open Data [website](https://data.worldbank.org/about), the majority of data comes from the statistical systems of member countries; therefore, while the Development Data Group upholds professional standards for quality and integrity, the quality of these data ultimately depend on the practices of the member countries. To support the larger goal of generating and making available good-quality statistical data on all aspects of development, the Development Data group coordinates with the Bank’s Global Practices and regional groups to “help developing countries improve the capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of national statistical systems.” (https://data.worldbank.org/about) Not only do timely and reliable statistics support the critical management decisions of the countries themselves, they inform the World Bank’s broad development strategy. \n\nMore information about the World Bank’s databases and global statistical strategy can be found [here](https://data.worldbank.org/about).\n\nThe World Development Indicators (WDI) is a centralized compilation of development indicators from international sources that are officially recognized by the World Bank. WDI presents the most accurate global development data that is currently available, and its database includes national, regional, and global estimates. The data used in this report are all sourced from the WDI collection on the Kingdom of Bhutan, which is organized by series (Economic Policy & Debt, Education, Environment, Financial Sector, Gender, Health, Infrastructure, Poverty, Private Sector & Trade, Public Sector, Social Protection & Labor, and Social: health) which each have many sub-categories. Each indicator (for example, “Adjusted net enrollment rate, primary, female (% of primary school age children)”) is published with a definition, source, (eg. [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](http://uis.unesco.org/). Data as of February 2020.), and details such as periodicity and aggregation method. \n\nFor each indicator’s specific dataset, the Development Data group has published short descriptions of the statistical concept and methodology, development relevance, and limitations and exceptions to the indicator. This documentation is crucial for interpretation of Bhutan’s data, as the Kingdom’s processes and standards for data collection and its participation in international surveys and data-sharing have all changed dramatically since 1960, when the WDI was established. Indeed, the first data from Bhutan for any indicator appears in 1970. This corresponds with the establishment of a statistical cell within [Bhutan’s Ministry of Development](https://www.nsb.gov.bt/about/background/) in 1971, the same year that Bhutan became a member of the United Nations. These events marked a major shift in Bhutan’s development paradigm, away from isolationist policies toward the development of international relations and diplomacy. It also marked the beginning of rapid modernization of the whole nation, including development of secular education. This development - among other other social, political, economic and environmental changes - has brought profound societal transformation. \n\n## Development Indicators for Bhutan: Education and Gender \n\nThe complete tabular dataset of nearly 1500 time series WDI for Bhutan is available for download on the World Bank’s Data Development [country page for Bhutan](https://data.worldbank.org/country/BT). The country page presents some basic plots showing trends for particular indicators over time. The [World Bank databank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators) allows users to query and download a tabular dataframe of specific indicators for a set of dates. This report thereby pulls from two series of World Development Indicators for Bhutan, “Education” and “Gender”, across the years 1970-2022 into a combined dataframe. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#read in data\nBhutanWDI<-read_csv(\"_data/Bhutan_WDI_Edu.csv\")%>%\n  select(-\"Country Name\", -\"Country Code\", -\"Series Name\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 152 Columns: 57\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (57): Country Name, Country Code, Series Name, Series Code, 1970 [YR1970...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the resulting dataframe, columns represent the years between 1970 and 2022, with each row being an indicator represented by a code. Each value in the dataset is a unique observation of an indicator in a particular year. All values are numeric, with a mixture of discrete and continuous data depending on the indicator. Most values represent percentages of a population or expenditure, ratios (eg. pupil-teacher ratio), points on a scale (eg. scale 1-100 on the Women Business and the Law Index Score, or the Gender Parity Index), or years (eg. of compulsory education). \n\nThe metadata for each indicator (the name and description for each code) can be seen in a corresponding Metadata dataframe.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in metadata\nWDImetadata<-read_csv(\"_data/Bhutan_WDI_Edu_Metadata.csv\",\n  skip = 153\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 147 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (12): Code, License Type, Indicator Name, Long definition, Source, Topic...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Education indicators can be classed into the following “series”: Efficiency, Inputs, Outcomes, and Participation.

It also includes a gender parity index for each level of schooling, which is calculated by dividing the female rate by the male rate. One can see each combination of variables within this group represented in the corresponding code for each indicator. \n\nOther indicator groups in the Participation series include: \n- number of pupils (across primary and secondary school, and genders);\n- children/adolescents out of school (across primary and secondary school, and genders);\n- adjusted net enrollment rate for primary school (across genders).\n\nIn the Outcomes series, indicator groups include: \n- duration education in years (for pre-primary, primary, secondary, and total compulsory education)\n- educational attainment of adults >25 (cumulative completion of each level of education, total and across genders)\n- completion rate (for primary and lower secondary school, total and across genders)\n- literacy rate (for youth and adult, total and across genders)\n\nIn the Inputs series, indicator groups include: \n- number of teachers (primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, total and across genders)\n- % trained teachers (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary, secondary, and upper secondary levels, total and across genders)\n\nIn the Efficiency series, indicator groups include: \n- gross and net intake ratios in grade 1 (total and across genders)\n- over-age students in primary school (total and across genders)\n- persistence to grade 5 (total and across genders)\n- progression to secondary school (total and across genders)\n- repeaters (total and across genders)\n\nFor any given year with data, the WDI series for education can be used to compare male and female enrollment, persistence, and completion of different levels of schooling, and where they deviate from the standard progression for their age group. These series also allow us to compare adults' educational attainment and literacy. Furthermore, these WDI can  be used to compare the gender ratios of teachers, and their respective levels of training, in each level of schooling -- allowing us to see any relationships between changing gender rations among teachers and student trends. \n\n## Rationale for this report - Draft, to be expanded after analysis\n\nBhutan is praised for its relative gender equity in society with respect to its country neighbors in Asia, but inequities persist and there seems to be some denial amongst the national and school leadership about the persistence and extent of gender inequity in schools. When I was working on the development of the Bhutan Baccalaureate for the Royal Secretariat, I experienced resistance to my suggestions that institutional policies must be sensitive to gender differences, and more data must be collected on the experiences of girls and women within schools. Furthermore, I was concerned that girls' and women's enrollment seemed low or inconsistent, and this was explained as a consequence of demands for household, family, or agricultural labor. Since the establishment of Bhutan's first democratic government in 2008, some national policies have highlighted the need for improving inclusion and outcomes for female youth, by and large these stated values and priorities have not been translated into programs and practices within schools. \n\n## Focus of analysis - Draft, to be expanded after analysis\n\nThis exploration of the World Bank’s Global Development Indicators related to education and gender is intended to explore the relationships among educational access, participation, and attainment across genders, in order to describe  patterns in female student engagement and outcomes over the past 25 years of collected data (1997-2022), with particular attention to patterns since the establishment of the first democratic government. I will look for variation in female enrollment with respect to major educational reforms and policy changes, and a possible relationship between trends in female student persistence and attainment with changes in the gender ratio and training of teachers.\n\nThese data can give us a view on girls' and women's access to and persistence in education - their bare participation - but the data can not give insight into the dynamics of inclusion within schools, nor the external conditions (eg. personal, familial, cultural, social, economic) which interfere with girls' or women's access to education. I will draw upon my research and personal experience working to develop Bhutan's education system to contextualize the observed trends and suggest possible hypotheses for further investigation.  \n\nThroughout this report, I will highlight the perceptible lacks and weaknesses in data, and emphasize the need for more extensive research on the situation of female Bhutanese to better diagnose sources of educational discrimination and exclusion. Without continuous collection of high quality data, it will be impossible to detect and understand problems, design interventions, and know when they are successful. \n\n## Patterns in Bhutan's Data Collection - Draft \n\nFor the reasons mentioned in the \"World Development Indicators\" section above, WDI data for Bhutan are non-existant until 1970. In the decades following, data collection gradually increased but remain patchy for many indicators. To see which indicators have data for which periods of time, we will create a XXXXX CHART for key indicators (i.e. those that form the basis for other indicators, and therefore can represent a group). \n\nTo start, I will tidy the dataframe so that each unique combination of indicator and year appear on a separate row, and each year is read as a date. I will also create a column of logical data indicating 'TRUE' if a value is present and 'FALSE' if data are missing. I will then create an additional column that with the missing data re-coded as \"NA\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#subtract all characters from the column name string, except characters 1-4\ncolnames(BhutanWDI) <- substr(colnames(BhutanWDI), 1, 4)\n\n#add the characters 0101 to the column name string, with no separation. This will allow the function ymd to read these strings as dates (after we pivot_longer into a column)\ncolnames(BhutanWDI) <- paste(colnames(BhutanWDI),\"0101\", sep=\"\")\n\n#pivot columns into a single \"Year\" column\nBhutanWDI_long<-BhutanWDI%>%\n  pivot_longer(cols=2:54, names_to=\"Year\", values_to=\"Value\")\n\n#convert the \"Year\" column into a date format for easier plotting \nBhutanWDI_long$Year <- ymd(BhutanWDI_long$Year)\n\n#create a data_present column indicating True if data are present\nBhutanWDI_long<-BhutanWDI_long%>%\n  mutate(data_present = ifelse(Value=='..',F,T))\n\n#re-code missing data in Value as NA in new column \"Value_withNA\"\nBhutanWDI_long<-BhutanWDI_long%>%\n  mutate(Value_withNA = na_if(Value, \"..\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis results in a dataframe in which each unique value is on its own row, with a unique combination of 2 variables: indicator and date. The problem with this dataframe is that the \"value\" column is not very useful for plotting. While the \"value\" column contains all numeric data, the numbers mean different things -- some are ratios, many are percentages of a designated population, some are year counts, and so on. \n\nTo see how a variable or variables (such as adult female and male literacy rates) have changed over time, we will need to make a new dataframe with relevant indicators with the same type of value. We could then create new columns with categorical data, eg. level of schooling, or gender, to add dimensions to the plot. \n\n###Plot the frequency of data entries - to be edited down\n\nWhen were data collected, and how much data was collected for a given year?
