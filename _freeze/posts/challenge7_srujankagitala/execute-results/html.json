And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n\nUsed the same dataset as in challenge 5.

There are details about 48895 stays. They are distributed across Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island neighbourhoods. The below table shows the number of stay options across New York neighbourhood.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narea_wise_stays\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 15 × 3\n# Groups:   neighbourhood_group [5]\n   neighbourhood_group room_type       count\n   <chr>               <chr>           <int>\n 1 Bronx               Entire home/apt   379\n 2 Bronx               Private room      652\n 3 Bronx               Shared room        60\n 4 Brooklyn            Entire home/apt  9559\n 5 Brooklyn            Private room    10132\n 6 Brooklyn            Shared room       413\n 7 Manhattan           Entire home/apt 13199\n 8 Manhattan           Private room     7982\n 9 Manhattan           Shared room       480\n10 Queens              Entire home/apt  2096\n11 Queens              Private room     3372\n12 Queens              Shared room       198\n13 Staten Island       Entire home/apt   176\n14 Staten Island       Private room      188\n15 Staten Island       Shared room         9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach stay option has information about id, name, host_id, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, latitude, longitude, room_type, price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, last_review, reviews_per_month, calculated_host_listings_count, availability_365.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nVariables like id and host_id are int but they are actually categorical. So, they have to be converted to factor. We can drop one of the columns out of \"host_id\" and \"name\" for exploratory analysis as they only act as primary keys. \"last_review\" column has to be converted to date format to represent the true data format. All character columns like neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, etc have to be converted to factor to get better insights on using summary. After this step, summary will give value counts for categorical variables and there will be 15 columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstay_data <- stay_data %>%\n  select(-name) %>%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>%\n  mutate(id = as.factor(id),\n         host_id = as.factor(host_id),\n         last_review = as.Date(last_review, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n\nsummary(stay_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       id             host_id             host_name        neighbourhood_group\n 2539   :    1   219517861:  327   Michael     :  417   Bronx        : 1091   \n 2595   :    1   107434423:  232   David       :  403   Brooklyn     :20104   \n 3647   :    1   30283594 :  121   Sonder (NYC):  327   Manhattan    :21661   \n 3831   :    1   137358866:  103   John        :  294   Queens       : 5666   \n 5022   :    1   12243051 :   96   Alex        :  279   Staten Island:  373   \n 5099   :    1   16098958 :   96   (Other)     :47154                         \n (Other):48889   (Other)  :47920   NA's        :   21                         \n            neighbourhood      latitude       longitude     \n Williamsburg      : 3920   Min.   :40.50   Min.   :-74.24  \n Bedford-Stuyvesant: 3714   1st Qu.:40.69   1st Qu.:-73.98  \n Harlem            : 2658   Median :40.72   Median :-73.96  \n Bushwick          : 2465   Mean   :40.73   Mean   :-73.95  \n Upper West Side   : 1971   3rd Qu.:40.76   3rd Qu.:-73.94  \n Hell's Kitchen    : 1958   Max.   :40.91   Max.   :-73.71  \n (Other)           :32209                                   \n           room_type         price         minimum_nights    number_of_reviews\n Entire home/apt:25409   Min.   :    0.0   Min.   :   1.00   Min.   :  0.00   \n Private room   :22326   1st Qu.:   69.0   1st Qu.:   1.00   1st Qu.:  1.00   \n Shared room    : 1160   Median :  106.0   Median :   3.00   Median :  5.00   \n                         Mean   :  152.7   Mean   :   7.03   Mean   : 23.27   \n                         3rd Qu.:  175.0   3rd Qu.:   5.00   3rd Qu.: 24.00   \n                         Max.   :10000.0   Max.   :1250.00   Max.   :629.00   \n                                                                              \n  last_review         reviews_per_month calculated_host_listings_count\n Min.   :2011-03-28   Min.   : 0.010    Min.   :  1.000               \n 1st Qu.:2018-07-08   1st Qu.: 0.190    1st Qu.:  1.000               \n Median :2019-05-19   Median : 0.720    Median :  1.000               \n Mean   :2018-10-04   Mean   : 1.373    Mean   :  7.144               \n 3rd Qu.:2019-06-23   3rd Qu.: 2.020    3rd Qu.:  2.000               \n Max.   :2019-07-08   Max.   :58.500    Max.   :327.000               \n NA's   :10052        NA's   :10052                                   \n availability_365\n Min.   :  0.0   \n 1st Qu.:  0.0   \n Median : 45.0   \n Mean   :112.8   \n 3rd Qu.:227.0   \n Max.   :365.0   \n                 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCleaned data has 15 columns.
