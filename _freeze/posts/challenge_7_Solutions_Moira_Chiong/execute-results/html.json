And anyone not familiar with Edward Tufte should check out his [fantastic books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) and [courses on data visualizaton.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses)\n\n(be sure to only include the category tags for the data you use!)\n\n## Read in data\n\nRead in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.\n\n  - eggs ⭐\n  - abc_poll ⭐⭐\n  - australian_marriage ⭐⭐\n  - hotel_bookings ⭐⭐⭐\n  - air_bnb  ⭐⭐⭐\n  - us_hh ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n  - faostat ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n## Read in Data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/chion/OneDrive/Desktop/DACSS 601/DACSS_601_Summer2023_Sec1/posts\")\nlibrary(readr)\nAB_NYC_2019 <- read_csv(\"_data/AB_NYC_2019.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Briefly describe the data\n\nThere are 48895 observations with 17 variables. The data set pertains to review and other administrative records for AirBnB in New York City. There are categorical variables in the data set, namely the boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and Bronx, as well as room type: private room, entire home/apartment and shared room. The dates of the last review range from March 2011 to July 2019. The minimum cost ranges from 0 to $1.2M. The mean minimum cost is $1284.43. The composition of the lodging by room type is as follows: 52% Entire home/apartment, 46% private room and 2.4% shared room. In terms of boroughs where the Airbnb lodging is located, 2% where in the Bronx, 41% in Brooklyn, 44% in Manhattan, 12% in Queens and 1% in Staten Island. \n\nThe minimum cost data is skewed right, with a mean of 1284 considerably higher than the median of 300. Similarly, the minimum nights data is also skewed right with a mean of 7.03 and a median of 3.0. This suggests that minimum cost and minimum nights is concentrated toward the lower ends of the scale- but be aware that the range is wide for the minimum cost and minimum nights, with smaller numbers on the scale still constituting considerable absolute numbers. \n\n## Summary Statistics\nAirbnbNYC.id      AirbnbNYC.minimum_cost AirbnbNYC.minimum_nights\n Min.   :    2539   Min.   :      0.0      Min.   :   1.00         \n 1st Qu.: 9471945   1st Qu.:    135.0      1st Qu.:   1.00         \n Median :19677284   Median :    300.0      Median :   3.00         \n Mean   :19017143   Mean   :   1284.4      Mean   :   7.03         \n 3rd Qu.:29152178   3rd Qu.:    734.5      3rd Qu.:   5.00         \n Max.   :36487245   Max.   :1170000.0      Max.   :1250.00   \n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nIs your data already tidy, or is there work to be done? Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n## Mutate Data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAirbnbNYC <- AB_NYC_2019 %>%\n\nmutate(`minimum_cost`= `price`*`minimum_nights`)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Summarize data\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAirbnbselect <- data.frame(AirbnbNYC$id,AirbnbNYC$minimum_cost,AirbnbNYC$minimum_nights)\nsummary(Airbnbselect)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  AirbnbNYC.id      AirbnbNYC.minimum_cost AirbnbNYC.minimum_nights\n Min.   :    2539   Min.   :      0.0      Min.   :   1.00         \n 1st Qu.: 9471945   1st Qu.:    135.0      1st Qu.:   1.00         \n Median :19677284   Median :    300.0      Median :   3.00         \n Mean   :19017143   Mean   :   1284.4      Mean   :   7.03         \n 3rd Qu.:29152178   3rd Qu.:    734.5      3rd Qu.:   5.00         \n Max.   :36487245   Max.   :1170000.0      Max.   :1250.00         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvis1a <- ggplot(AirbnbNYC, aes(x=last_review, y=minimum_cost, color=room_type)) +\n     geom_point(size=5) +\n  labs(y= \"Minimum Cost\", x= \"Date of Last Review\", color= \"Room Type\", title = \"Minimum Cost over Date of Last Review\") +\n  theme(panel.background=element_rect(colour=\"blue\"))\nprint(vis1a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge_7_Solutions_Moira_Chiong_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvis2a <-    \n ggplot(AirbnbNYC, aes(factor(room_type), fill = factor(neighbourhood_group))) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge2\") +\n  labs(x=\"Room Type\", y=\"Count\", fill=\"Borough\", title=\"Number of AirBnB listings by Room Type and Borough\") +  \n  theme(panel.background=element_rect(colour=\"blue\")) \nprint(vis2a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](challenge_7_Solutions_Moira_Chiong_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
