## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to

1)  read in a data set, and describe the data using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2)  provide summary statistics for different interesting groups within the data, and interpret those statistics

## Read in the Data

Read in one (or more) of the following data sets, available in the `posts/_data` folder, using the correct R package and command.

-   railroad\*.csv or StateCounty2012.xls ⭐
-   FAOstat\*.csv or birds.csv ⭐⭐⭐
-   hotel_bookings.csv ⭐⭐⭐⭐

#install packages to read in an excel file

install.packages("readxl") 
library("readxl")
birds <- read_excel("C:\Users\chion\OneDrive\Desktop\DACSS 601\Challenge 2\birds.xlsx")

```{r}

```

Add any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.

## Describe the data

Using a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).

#This data set was a much larger dataset than in Challenge 1. There was a mix of categorical and numerical data. There were 14 columns of variables, with 30977 rows of observations. The variable, BIrds$Value had the following summary statistics:
  
 # Value Summary Statistics
#Mean 99410.63
#Median 1800
#IQR 15233

#I did some simple proportion statistics on Birds$Item, or seeing the proportionality of chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowls, pigeons and other birds and turkeys:
  
  
 # 
  #Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls   Pigeons, other birds 
#0.42205507             0.22303645             0.13351842             0.03760855 
#Turkeys 
#0.18378152 

#From this analysis it can be seen that Chickens at 42%, then Ducks at 22% followed by Turkeys (18%) were most prevalent in the dataset. I also tabulated the data by Area and Item, and found that 

#In 2018, there were the following instances of Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys:
  
 # Chickens Ducks Geese and guinea fowls Pigeons, other birds Turkeys 
#2018       240   128                     78                   21     110


#The summary statistics on the item category for the Value variable is as follows. Note that Chickens had the highest mean and median, followed by Ducks and Turkeys.

#$Chickens
#Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.     NA's 
 #      0     1136    10784   207931    53794 23707134      104 

#$Ducks
 #  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
#0      61     510   23072    4700 1195783     417 

#$`Geese and guinea fowls`
#Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
#     0      41     258   10292    1561  390848     139 

#$Pigeons, other birds`
 #  Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
#0    1034    2800    6163    7600   57909      58 

#$Turkeys
#Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
 #     0      93     528   15228    3186  473583     318 

#Here are some more summary statistics, by the categorical variable Item:

#birds$Item       Mean  Median     IQR
#1               Chickens 207930.808 10783.5 52657.0
#2                  Ducks  23071.673   510.0  4639.0
#3 Geese and guinea fowls  10291.937   258.0  1520.0
#4   Pigeons, other birds   6163.375  2800.0  6566.5
#5                Turkeys  15227.919   528.0  3093.5

#It is clear from the data set that Chickens, Ducks and Turkeys are the most consumed in the world.

## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics
#See above
Conduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.

```{r}

```

### Explain and Interpret

Be sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.

Add any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.
