## Education/Work Background
I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering from UMass Amherst in 2020. I then worked for 2.5 years in HVAC Engineering, during which time I found an interest in programming and computer science. I took prerequisite computer science courses online, and was subsequently accepted back to UMass Amherst to pursue my MS in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing this degree and working part time as a BIM developer.

## R experience
I have decent programming experience but no experience using R. 

## Research interests
I am interested in software engineering.

## Hometown

## Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include: gym, soccer, video games, music, going out with friends.

## Fun fact
I have run a half marathon, and want to run a full one someday soon.
