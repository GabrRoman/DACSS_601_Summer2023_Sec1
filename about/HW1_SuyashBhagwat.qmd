## Education/Work Background
**Ans:** I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Intel and pursuing my part-time MSCS degree at UMass Amherst. I also have completed my Bachelors in Engineering from ICT, Mumbai. 

## R experience
**Ans:** I had taken a Coursera course 'Data Visualization and Analysis in R' about 3 years ago. The course taught me some basic data wrangling techniques and also introduced me to data visualization. But since it has been 3 years since I took the course, I still need to brush up on some of the data wrangling and visualization techniques.

## Research interests
**Ans:** I will be graduating this semester and I have not taken any research credits in my MS study. But in Spring 2023, I took CS685 Natural Language Processing and I was fascinated by how large language models work (especially ChatGPT). Given a choice, in future I would like to do some research in the field of NLP.

## Hometown
**Ans:** I live in Sacramento, CA but I am originally from Mumbai, India.

## Hobbies
**Ans:** I like reading books (especially non-fiction). I am currently reading 'The science of Interstellar' by Kip Thorne. My other hobbies include traveling and working out at the gym.

## Fun fact
**Ans:** I like collecting fridge magnets from every major city/destination/national park I have visited. Currently I have over 100 fridge magnet on my fridge. I also love collecting naturally occurring crystals and minerals. Fun fact, I have a large crystal of the heaviest non-radioactive element that is lying around in my living room (hint: Its used in peptobismol!).
