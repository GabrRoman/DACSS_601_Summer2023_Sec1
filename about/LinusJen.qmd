## Education/Work Background

I graduated from UCLA in 2021 with a B.S. in statistics, and started my master's at UMass right after graduation. I've been working with MassMutual for about 2 years now as a jr. data scientist.

## R experience

R was the first "programming" language I learned, and I used it extensively during undergrad. However, I haven't touched R much since spring 2021, as I wanted to develop my Python skills. At one point in time, I'd say I was much more experienced with R, but I have forgotten a lot of things since then.

## Research interests

My interests mainly lie with data science overall - data wrangling, feature engineering and selection, and modeling. I do miss the interpretability and analysis aspect of stats (as black box models usually outperform linear models). I took COMPSCI 685 (Advanced NLP) this past semester, and would like to continue learning more about NLP as the field grows (though at this point, I don't know anyone who doesn't say they're interested in NLP).

## Hometown

I'm from Monterey Park, CA (a suburb in LA), and lived there until moving here to Amherst.

## Hobbies

Basketball is my main passion in life, and when I'm back in LA, I play a lot of pickleball.

## Fun fact

My family is named alphabetically starting from my oldest aunt (Anita) all the way down to me (Linus) and my sister (Megan).
